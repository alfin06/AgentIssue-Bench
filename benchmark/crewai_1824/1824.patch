+### Troubleshooting Dependencies
+
+If you encounter issues during installation or usage, here are some common solutions:
+
+#### Common Issues
+
+1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**
+   - Install tiktoken explicitly: `pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'`
+   - If using embedchain or other tools: `pip install 'crewai[tools]'`
+
+2. **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**
+   - Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above)
+   - For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
+   - Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
+   - If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`
+
+3. **Version Conflicts**
+   - If you see dependency conflicts with tiktoken, try installing specific extras:
+     ```bash
+     pip install 'crewai[tools,embeddings]'  # For full functionality
+     pip install crewai  # For core features only
+     ```
+
+For additional help, check the [tiktoken troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken#troubleshooting).
